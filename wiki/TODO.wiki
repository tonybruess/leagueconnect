Overall:
  Make a more descriptive dashboard so to say.
  User Permissions:
  User permissions should be setup as follows. Each number should be setup in ./classes/permissions.php
* 1: Login
* 2: Read/Send Mail
* 3: Administer News
* 4: Administer Matches
* 5: Administer Teams
* 6: Administer Bans
* 7: Administer Pages
* 8: Administer Users
* 9: Administer Logs
  These permissions need to be redone
Mail:
  Make a universal timestamp
  Send to more then one person
  Send to an entire team
  Edit CSS to better display all of the messages and such
  Back and forth button to read through messages
News:
  Allow editing of news articles
  Modulize the entire edit/new form for easy use
  Matches:
  Create Match SQL Table
  Add formula for calculating match +/- points
  Calculate activity each time a match is played
Teams:
  Add detail page for teams
  Add edit page for teams
  Look into error messages better so we can tell the user exactly what they did wrong
Players:
  List all players here
  Allow players to edit their profile from this page and home page
  Allow viewing of other profiles and editing through user manager
Pages:
  Allow better functionality for adding/deleteing/renaming pages (right now theres four static pages)
User Manager:
  Show all users, last login, 
Team Manager:
  View all teams
  Revive a team
  Edit team information
Logs:
  Eventually hope to have an LogEvent function which logs all user actions
  LogEvent would make it simple and would be a log of the userid, page, time, and a short description of the action
